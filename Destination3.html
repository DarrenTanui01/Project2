    <p>Chinatown is a vibrant neighborhood in Singapore that blends Chinese heritage with modernity. It's made up of four sub-areas that were developed at different times: Telok Ayer (1820s), Kreta Ayer (1830s), Bukit Pasoh (early 1900s), and Tanjong Pagar (1920s). Chinatown is known for its hawker centers, temples, teahouses, bars, cafes, and independent art galleries.</p>
